# Introduction

This is a Data Science project based on Simple Linear Regression Algorithm. Simple linear regression models a variable Y as being, aside from a random error, a linear function of another variable X. The parameters of this linear relationship are unknown and need to be estimated.


The accuracy of a Simple Linear Regression depends on the trained set and the tested set. Graph which represents the accuracy of the algorithm is given below:-
